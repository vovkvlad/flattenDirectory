#Directory flattener

The main purpose of this python util is 
to flatten directory copying files nested on all levels to some
destination folder.

## Reasoning
It can be done in many more appropriate ways, but I decided to
implement it as a part of my python learning, and I choose this task
due to irritation I get because of nested folders created by iTunes, when you import your
library, and ideally I want all song to be under one big junk folder

## Usage

```bash
python3.6 main.py ~/test/src ~/test/dist
```
